# Checking Out YouTube’s Video Playing UX

So I went ahead and opened up a YouTube video, like I usually do when I’m bored. This time, for some reason, I was feeling like checking out a little Ted Talk. The one I picked happened to be “How to learn any language in six months,” by Chris Lonsdale. Though, instead of going ahead and watching the video, after I clicked on the video, I decided to pause it and appreciate YouTube’s UX.

<div align="center">

    <p>This is what I was greeted with when I clicked on the video.</p>
</div>

As you can see in the image, the video is featured on the left-hand side of the screen; with recommended videos on the right hand side of the screen, and more information about the video just below the video. It honestly appears that the main video, itself, takes up less of the area of the page than all the other elements on the page.

I decided to unpause the video after giving the UI a little look over, and shortly after, I was thinking that there has to be a way to get the video (the reason why I’m on YouTube) to be more prominent on my screen. Maybe to get it fullscreen or some other choice that lets me interact with other things on the page.

So I went ahead and hovered over the video, and was greeted with the updated page below.

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/first-journal-images/on-hover-and-theater.png" style="max-width: 700px; width: 100%;">
    <p>When you hover over the image, you are greeted with a multitude of options to change the behavior of the video.</p>
</div>

Ok, I actually did a little more than hover over the video— I actually also pressed the theater mode button (or pressed “t,” for theater) to enlarge the video, in addition to hovering over the video.

In this hovered and enlarged state, the watcher is presented with a multitude of choices to change their video viewing experience. The obvious possible choices, including, play/pause, volume adjustment, seeking through the video, a fullscreen toggle, and captions toggle were all present. All stuff a user would find on basically any video player on your computer; which makes it very familiar for nearly anyone that has watched a video using a computer. Additionally, YouTube has a few extras, like theater mode, with its very unique icon, which I mentioned before, the autoplay button, which plays a video right after the current one finishes, and then the gear icon that allows you to change various other aspects about how the video is played, like video quality.

In my opinion, I think that the theater icon is a little ambiguous for new users. I don’t think I really understood what it even did until I saw other people using it and realized how useful it could be while watching video. Now I use it all the time. Similar to the autoplay button, but in reverse. YouTube kind of forces the autoplay button on you when you first start using YouTube. They have it on by default and that’s the only reason I’d assume that anyone would even know what it did unless they got curious.

In contrast, the gear icon is something that a user may assume allows you to change the “settings” of the video. When you click on it, you’re presented with the options in the image below.

<div align="center">

    <p>With the changes to the video including, subtitles, playback speed, quality, and more, as the image shows.</p>
</div>

The playback quality is pretty standard for internet video players. I would say the same for changing the playback speed and subtitles, but relative to software video players more broadly rather than just purely internet players.

It does look like YouTube has a few extra things that most other internet and/or software video players don’t have. For example, I am honestly not really familiar with what ambient mode does. That’s new to me. I can guess that “Stable Volume” may reduce peaking in the video and make the audio nicer if it was mixed poorly by the videographer or just generally not wanted by the user. I’ve also never used the “Sleep timer,” but I think that by its name, the user could pretty easily assume that it can be used to stop the video after a certain amount of time. Whether it’s *them* sleeping or the video when the timer goes up.

For annotations, I’m only familiar with it because I have used YouTube a lot— it’s used for allowing or disallowing info elements being written over the video player. I feel like as a new user, it’d be kind of hard to understand what this does unless you went ahead and turned it off and then appreciated what was missing when it was off vs. when you had it on.

After getting the video all tuned up and playing like I like, I wanted to get a better idea of some background of the video while I listened. So I decided to scroll down to engage a little bit with the video, and I was presented with the below portion of the page.

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/first-journal-images/video-description.png" style="max-width: 700px; width: 100%;">
    <p>Here’s most of the description of the video (below is just socials for the channel and a YouTube-generated transcript from the captions)</p>
</div>

Just below the video gives you some date and viewing information about the video, and then expands into a full description of the video, as posted by the channel that uploaded it.

This is relatively new, but just below the description, it’s apparent that YouTube pulls “Key moments” from the video. Which was kind of funny, because, in the hovered state of the video, in the first picture of my journal, there were no timestamps placed by the makers of the video. So, it seems that these are auto-generated by YouTube— at least as a user, myself, I’m assuming that. But, overall, the “Key moments” section is very clear and easy to follow as a user in terms of its usefulness in helping me parse the video **efficiently**.

Finally, I scrolled just pasted the description box of the video, and was greeted with a comment section. The top of which can be seen in the image below.

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/first-journal-images/video-comments.png" style="max-width: 700px; width: 100%;">
    <p>I didn’t want to show any actual comments, just in case they were crazy.</p>
</div>

Clearly, it has a super simple layout. It tells you how many comments there are, you can sort through and see what people have said, and it has an indicator of where you can add a comment with “Add a comment…” and an underline below it.

Now that I had looked through a little bit about the video, I decided to go back and really watch the video. After a while, I finished watching it. Now I know how I can learn Russian quickly to say hello to someone in St. Petersburg\!

After the video was over, I was still bored, and took myself out of theater mode and looked back at the videos on the right hand side. The thumbnails **effectively** helped me to get an idea of what the video looked like, and the titles in combination with them helped me to get an idea of what they were about.

<div align="center">

    <p>The recommended videos from the first image in my journal.</p>
</div>

I decided to pick the video with the most views. If everyone else wants to hear about it, why shouldn’t I?

And then the cycle of YouTube continues for its users until the user decides to close the site.
